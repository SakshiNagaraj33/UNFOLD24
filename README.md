# SimpleWeb3Auth
A project that demonstrates how to use a MetaMask wallet as a mechanism for website login and authentication.

This application consists of two parts. The first part is the web server. The second part is the client side web page that's used to access logic hosted on the web server.

The source code for the web server is located at [./src/server.js](./src/server.js).

The web page HTML is located at [./src/public/index.html](./src/public/index.html). The client side logic used by the HTML in the web page is located at [./src/public/functions.js](./src/public/functions.js).

# System requirements
